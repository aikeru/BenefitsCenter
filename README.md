A demo application to help illustrate some tooling available today for JavaScript and VS2013.

This is a very simple shell project. It contains just enough to show unit testing through Chutzpah or qunit/linting through a gulp task.

On Windows 8, this project should pop up a notification when JavaScript code is saved and unit tests fail. Code for growl notifications is included but is commented out.
